Ha-ah
Ha-ah

I've been here before
Same summer air filled up my lung once more
So hard to breathe
Trapped in these mirrored doors, oh

Tell me how to tie
These fragments of time with the thread in my hand
The clouds roll in, blocking my view
I have to stand on my tiptoe to see it through, ooh

If I could cut up the endless loop
I'll take the amber's glow, once trapped my hope
To light up my new road
Stay with me like how we used to be
Until we find a world (Ah)
Where goodbyes are no more

When you're by my side
The stars align to form a line of signs
As the whole world was crumbling down
We drew stardust into our arms
It still shines bright, ooh

If I could cut up the endless loop
I'll take the amber's glow, once trapped my hope
To light up my new road
Stay with me like how we used to be
Until we find a world
Where goodbyes are no more

No matter how far you may rove (No matter)
This Thread will lead you through it all (Through it all)
But when the road feels far too long (Far too long)
Just know that we'll leave the light on (Just for you)

It's alright, our thread will always stay
Let tears stream down your face
Wash clean your pain, you've come a long way
Look over there beyond the borderline
A thousand lanterns shine
They will guide you back home
Until we find a world
Stay with me, like how we used to be
Until we find a world, ha

Ha-ah
Ha-ah
Where goodbyes are no more
